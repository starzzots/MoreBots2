# MoreBots2 — OSRS Color Detection Automation Bot

This is a custom-built automation tool for Old School RuneScape (OSRS) that detects specific RGB values on screen and moves the mouse to a randomized coordinate within a defined rectangle around the match. 

Built entirely in Python, this tool was designed as a learning project in automation, GUI interaction, and color detection — and evolved into a fully functional botting system.

## 🧠 Features
- RGB screen color detection
- Configurable coordinate search areas
- Randomized mouse movements for anti-detection
- `.exe` packaging for Windows with `pyinstaller`
- Modular design (`Randomize`, agility, runecrafting, fishing, mining bots.)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- `pyautogui`
- `keyboard`
- `time`, `random`, `win32api`, etc.

## 💡 Why I Built This
I built this as a self-taught developer to learn more about:
- GUI automation
- Programmatic mouse and keyboard control
- Real-world applications of Python scripting

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
