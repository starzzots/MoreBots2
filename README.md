# MoreBots2 — OSRS Color Detection Automation Bot

This is a custom-built automation tool for Old School RuneScape (OSRS) that detects specific RGB values on screen and moves the mouse to a randomized coordinate within a defined rectangle around the match. 

Built entirely in Python, this tool was designed as a learning project in automation, GUI interaction, and color detection — and evolved into a fully functional botting system.

## 🧠 Features
- RGB screen color detection
- Configurable coordinate search areas
- Randomized mouse movements for anti-detection
- `.exe` packaging for Windows with `pyinstaller`
- Modular design (`Randomize`, agility, runecrafting, fishing, mining bots.)

## 📸 Screenshots
Quickly running ardy.exe to show the script detecting color and moving mouse to location and clicking. "ESC" to close the program a pop up will show up saying the bot has been stopped
